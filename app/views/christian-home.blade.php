        We currently have 29 children living with us ranging in age from four to sixteen years old.  
        All of them enjoy good food, education, social status and every right an ordinary child has. 
        It is the mercy of God and the co-operation of faithful sponsors that have enabled the 
        children to enjoy all of these benefits.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Without your help, many of these children would have no place to live, no one to watch over 
        them, no one to teach them about the love of Jesus.  For only $30 a month, we can provide 
        one child with a safe place to live, adult house parents who watch over them, food, clothing 
        and a Christian environment.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Will you partner with us in reaching the children of Kerala, for Christ?
