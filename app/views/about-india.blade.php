                 India is one of the fastest growing countries in the world.  In 2008, the population was estimated 
                 at over 1 billion people.  The main religion of India is Hindu and many of the cities and regions 
                 in India are named after Indian deities.  One example, is the city of Mumbai.  When India was a 
                 colony of England, Mumbai was know as Bombay.  In 1996, the name was officially changed to Mumbai.  
                 The name Mumbai is a derivative of the name of a locally worshiped Hindu goddess, Mumba Devi.  
                 About 80% of the population of India consider themselves Hindu.  Islam is the second most popular 
                 religion (13%), followed by Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.  Christians comprise about 3% of the 
                 population of India.
