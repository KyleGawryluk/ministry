            <strong>Believe</strong>
            <br>
            And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe 
            that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. (Hebrews 11:6). Repent of past sins
            In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.

            from being baptized?”  And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he answered 
            and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”

            “Peter replied, “Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the 
            forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”
